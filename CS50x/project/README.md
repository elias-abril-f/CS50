# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/2NxNQrLeb38
#### Name: Elias Abril-Fernandez
#### City: London, UK
#### Description:

This is CustomBoard, an Android app that acts as a controller for a set of LED lights installed on a bouldering wall and allows the user to create, store and rate and share boulder problems, and send them to the LED lights to have a visual representation of the problem, so the climber can concentrate in making the next move instead of remembering the next move.

The app centres around ultimate customization. You can take a picture of you climbing wall, select the holds you want to use (or all of them!) and then you have two options:
    - You can create your own problem by tapping the holds you want to include in your problem. Tap the same hold to change the colour of the light to indicate a start hold, foothold, regular or top hold. When you're happy with the result you can send it to your wall to see the lights, test it, make changes... it's up to you! If you like the end result you can save the problem for later, give it a name and a grade.

    - Next option is to go to the gallery and select one of your saved problems. You can see a preview of the problem with a circle on the right colour overimposed over the right holds on a screenshot of your wall. If you want to climb that problem you can send it to the wall and start climbing straight away without having to remember the moves, just follow the lights!

The advantage over other systems like the MoonBoard or KilterBoard is that you don't need a specific set of holds with set positions. CustomBoard allows you to use any wall and any holds. Just take a picture, select the holds and be creative.

When you first click on the app you'll see the CustomBoard logo for a few seconds while the rest of the app loads. Once everything is ready, you will land in the CustomBoar website (officially not part of the project, but you are welcome to visit at www.thecustomboard.com) where you can see more material on how the app works, as well as purchasing a licence, a full kit and download the app.

The first time you log in, the app will ask you to introduce your purchase code. Without it the app will still work, but it will not interact with the light set. Also, the first time you use the app with a CustomBoard LED controller you will have to link the controller via your phoneâ€™s bluetooth app before being able to use it in the app. Once that is done, you can go to the bluetooth icon in the CustomBoard navigation bar and select your controller from the list of available devices.

After connecting the app and the controller you are ready to start using the app. You can take a picture of your wall or upload a previously taken photo from your gallery. This image can be rotated in case your wall shows up in a different orientation. In this section of the app you can also edit the placement of the holds. In future versions of the app you will also be able to add more holds and change the size of the markers.

Once your wall and holds are to your liking, you can go to the create section to start making boulder problems. Just tap the hold you want to use to make a green circle appear. If you want to change the colour just keep tapping a hold and it will cycle: green-red-blue-off. If you have purchased the app you will be able to send your problem to your controller and make the LEDs show you the problem in your wall. If you tap save you will be prompted to name and grade your problem.

In the gallery section you will find your previously saved problems, with name and grade. At the very top there is a search bar that allows you to find a specific problem by typing its name or grade. By tapping the preview button you will see a screenshot of your problem showing you your wall with the circles superimposed. Lastly, if you have introduced your purchase code, you can send the problem to your wall LED kit.
